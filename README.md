## Instructions

This is a Memory Game. The cards are turned over before the game begins. Once the first card is clicked, it is flipped over to reveal the face of the card and the timer begins signifying the start of a game. The player selects another card. If the card is matches the original card selected, the player has a match and both cards are turned over. If not, the player must continue to find a match.  The player is given 3 stars at the start of the game. If the player does not find all of the matches by 17 moves, they lose a star, after 24 moves they lose another star. The goal is to find all matches in under 17 moves. Once all cards are matched the game is over and the player will view their game stats and the timer, the number of stars and moves are reset and the cards are turned over again.


## Installation
To play the game, download the folder and open the index.html in a web browser.
